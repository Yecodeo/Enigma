During World War II, the Germans were using an encryption code machine called :lock: Enigma â€“ which was basically an encryption machine that encrypted messages for transmission. The Enigma code went many years unbroken. Here's How the basic machine works:    
    
 #### :triangular_ruler: How it works 
First, `Caesar shift` is applied using an incrementing number:    
If string is  :

 

> **AAA** and starting number is  **4** then output will be  **EFG**.
> 

> So : **A + 4 = E     A + 4 + 1 = F     A + 4 + 1 + 1 = G**

  
  Now map  **EFG** to first ROTOR such as:    
  

> **ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ     BDFHJLCPRTXVZNYEIWGAKMUSQO**

  
So  **EFG** becomes  **JLC**. Then it is passed through 2 more rotors to get the final value.    
    
If the second ROTOR is  **AJDKSIRUXBLHWTMCQGZNPYFVOE**, we apply the substitution step again thus:    
  

> **ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ     AJDKSIRUXBLHWTMCQGZNPYFVOE**

  
So  **JLC** becomes  **BHD**.    
    
If the third ROTOR is  **EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ**, then the final substitution is:    
  

> **ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ     EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ**

  
So  **BHD** becomes  **KQF**.

   Final, output is send via Radio Transmitter.
